# poetryCode
This code runs my randomly generated poetry generator. It reads in a file, selects random sentences (not the long ones) and types out a 3 line poem. I removed lines breaks and quotations as I believed they broke the feel if the reader is focused on grammar.  I chose Old Granny Fox by Thornton W. Burgess for my input file because I wanted to generate something errie and off-setting, and I beleive some of the shorter lines from this book fit. I chose to print 3 sentences because I feel it is enough structure to lead the reader into deeper thought as to what it could mean, without it sounding goofy or obviously randomly generated.
